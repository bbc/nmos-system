# AMWA IS-09 NMOS System API Specification [Work In Progress]

The NMOS System API allows an NMOS Node (also known as a "Media Node") to find Resources that are common across a system.
This enables the Node to start, or re-start, in a well defined way that is consistent with the environment it's running in.

It has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifcations.

The formal specification is provided at in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-system). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (which are specified in RAML and JSON Schema).

The documenation and API links immediately below, and the links in the page heading, are for the main development branch. Links to [other releases (tags)](tags/) and [other branches](branches/) appear later in the page, or under "VERSIONS..." in the page heading.

Once AMWA has approved a Specification, its documentation and API links will be for the _most recent approved release_ (which may be earlier than what is shown by the default branch on the GitHub repo).
